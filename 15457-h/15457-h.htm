<p>It is said that the unfortunate Princess Charlotte of Belgium is to be
taken over to Mexico, in the hope that a visit to the scenes of her former
happiness may restore her reason.</p>

<p>Her story brings back to memory a very sad and interesting page of our
modern history.</p>

<p>Princess Charlotte, the daughter of Leopold I., King of the Belgians, was
the most accomplished and beautiful princess of her time. She was the only
daughter of the king. While she was still quite young he found she had a
great talent for statecraft, and so he had her admitted to all the
councils of state, and from her earliest childhood she was familiar with
the ways and arts of diplomacy.</p>

<p>A brilliant future was expected for her, but when she was seventeen she
married, for love, the young Archduke Maximilian, brother of the Emperor
of Austria.</p>

<p>There was no expectation that Maximilian would ever come to a throne, and
so it seemed as if the young princess' talents were to be thrown away when
<a name="Page_630" id="Page_630"></a>she settled down with her husband, and became the happiest young wife in
Europe.</p>

<p>For seven years these two young folks were a model happy couple; then, one
fatal day, Napoleon III. of France offered Maximilian the crown of Mexico.</p>

<p>Europe thought that Mexico needed a wise and clever ruler to straighten
out the tangle into which its affairs had fallen, and it was supposed that
Maximilian, backed by his beautiful and clever wife, would be just the man
for the post. As Mexican affairs were in a very turbulent state, Napoleon
promised Maximilian that he would keep a number of French troops in the
country, and support him with an armed force, until the people of Mexico
had learned to love and trust him, and he could rule them without danger.</p>

<p>Under these conditions Maximilian accepted, and the young couple became
Emperor and Empress of Mexico, and, setting forth to their new land, bade
farewell to Europe and happiness.</p>

<p>At that time Mexico was in the most terrible condition, as you will
understand when you learn that within a period of forty-seven years there
were three hundred revolutions, some successful, some the reverse. During
this time the government was changed ten times, and over fifty persons
succeeded each other as presidents, dictators, and emperors.</p>

<p>The throne of such an uneasy kingdom as this was by no means a pleasant
one to occupy.</p>

<p>During these frequent revolutions it is easy to understand that many
treaties were broken, and much property was seized.</p>

<p>The foreign residents in particular found Mexico a dangerous country to
live in, and within a few <a name="Page_631" id="Page_631"></a>years Spain, England, and France were making
heavy claims against the country for damage done to their citizens.</p>

<p>The claims of England and Spain were satisfied, and they withdrew the
troops they had sent to Mexico to enforce their demands.</p>

<p>France, however, could get no satisfaction, and so she remained, and
carried on war against the Mexicans until she succeeded in getting a
little the best of them.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Louis Napoleon made up his mind that an Emperor
was what Mexico needed, and sent out the unfortunate Archduke Maximilian
to rule a wild, boisterous, and only half-conquered people.</p>

<p>The Mexicans, ever pleased with a change, welcomed the Emperor very
kindly; the beauty and charity of the Empress made many friends for her,
and for a time all went well.</p>

<p>With the aid of the French troops, Maximilian completed the conquest of
the rebellious Mexicans, and was at the height of his popularity, when, in
an evil moment, he made a proclamation that all the rebels who had fought
against the government should be regarded as bandits, and punished as
such.</p>

<p>The people were furious at this. These bandits were many of them of their
own families and friends, and revolutions were so common in the country,
that they could not see why these men should be hanged and shot by a
foreign prince, whom they had never invited to come and govern them.</p>

<p>From that moment they began to conspire against him, and his position was
becoming very unsafe, when Napoleon ordered his French soldiers to return
from Mexico.<a name="Page_632" id="Page_632"></a></p>

<p>Maximilian would not allow this; he reminded Napoleon that he had only
accepted the throne on the condition that the French soldiers were left to
protect him; but Napoleon III. paid no attention to his protest, nor to
the assurance that he would not be safe if the French soldiers were
withdrawn.</p>

<p>The orders to return to France were repeated.</p>

<p>Both Maximilian and Charlotte were fearful of the result of this rash act;
and as the Empress had been very successful in managing several difficult
affairs in the government of Mexico, it was thought best that she should
go to Napoleon and explain things to him, and get the order for the
soldiers to remain in Mexico.</p>

<p>She started on her long voyage, hopeful of success; but when she reached
France, Napoleon managed to avoid seeing her for months, and when at last
she was admitted to his presence, she found him cold, hard, and determined
to follow out his own plans.</p>

<p>The French soldiers should leave Mexico at all cost.</p>

<p>The poor young Empress had lived long enough in Mexico to fear the worst
for her husband if he were left to the tender mercies of the Mexicans.
Heartbroken at Napoleon's refusal, she determined to seek the Pope, and
see if he would not help her.</p>

<p>The Pope received her with the greatest kindness, but soon convinced her
that, no matter how good his will, he had no power to aid her.</p>

<p>When Charlotte realized this, and that her long journey had been of no
use, and that she had only separated herself from her beloved husband in
his hour of need, her mind gave way, and she became insane.</p>

<p>Poor Maximilian, waiting anxiously for news of her <a name="Page_633" id="Page_633"></a>success, received word
that his troubles had driven his wife insane, and from that moment he
cared little what became of him or of Mexico.</p>

<p>A few months after Napoleon had so treacherously withdrawn his troops, the
people once more rose against their ruler.</p>

<p>The Emperor led his army of loyal Mexicans against the rebels, but after a
few weeks was defeated, taken prisoner, and condemned to be shot.</p>

<p>So ended the career of these two unfortunate young people.</p>

<p>It is thought that the Empress to this hour does not know the fate that
befell her husband.</p>

<p>The whole sad tragedy happened thirty years ago, and in all that time she
has never had a glimmering of reason. She is gentle, kindly, and
interested in the simple country life of the estate on which she lives.
Her madness has never taken a violent form, and it is said that she lives
in constant expectation of her husband's return.</p>

<p>Of late her mind has become slightly clearer, and her doctors have decided
that it is possible that her reason may be restored if she once more
visits Mexico.</p>

<p>This decision seems hardly a kindly one. If it be true that the poor
Empress, who is now a woman of fifty-seven, does not know the full force
of the sorrows that fell upon her, it would seem kinder to leave her in
ignorance of them, than to restore her reason, and allow her to suffer for
griefs that are now thirty years old.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Europe has again been shocked by the news of Christian Powers firing on
the Greeks, and endeavoring <a name="Page_634" id="Page_634"></a>to prevent them from freeing themselves from
the rule of the hated heathen Turk.</p>

<p>The feeling in England is very strong on this point. So much so that the
old statesman, Mr. Gladstone, who is to England what Bismarck has been to
Germany, has published a very fine letter on the subject.</p>

<p>In the strongest kind of language, Mr. Gladstone calls the Powers to
account for the action they are taking. He declares that they are
listening to the advice of two ambitious young rulers, the Emperor of
Germany and the Czar of Russia, and allowing themselves to be guided by
the desires of these young men, instead of listening to the voice of the
people, which is decidedly against their actions.</p>

<p>He speaks in no friendly terms of Turkey, her massacres and her misrule,
and says that Greece has done a great service for the world in helping
Crete to throw off the yoke of such a sovereign as the Sultan.</p>

<p>He hopes that the people of Europe may be allowed to say what they think
in the matter, and feels confident that Greece will then no longer be
interfered with. He thinks the only true way to settle the difficulty, is
to let the Cretans have their own government under the rule of Greece, and
pay tribute to Turkey.</p>

<p>Every one is wondering whether these bold words of Mr. Gladstone will have
an effect on the situation.</p>

<p>The so-called Concert of the Powers does not seem to exist any longer. The
six powers are divided among themselves. Great Britain and Italy hold
together in not wanting harsh measures used with Greece; Germany and
Russia think force ought to be used, and France and Austria are
undecided.<a name="Page_635" id="Page_635"></a></p>

<p>Some of the foreign papers are saying that it is quite impossible for the
Powers ever to come to an understanding.</p>

<p>Some people are thinking that Mr. Gladstone's letter has already had an
effect, for a private telegram from Paris states that the Sultan of Turkey
has sent word to the Powers that he is willing to let King George of
Greece occupy the island of Crete, and govern it, provided that he pays
tribute for it.</p>

<p>This is so exactly Mr. Gladstone's suggestion, that, if the report is
true, the Sultan would seem to have been influenced by him.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone in his letter showed clearly how such an arrangement would
be of benefit to all concerned, and spoke of the island of Cyprus as an
example. Cyprus was once under the rule of Turkey, but is now governed by
the Queen of England, and pays a tribute to Turkey.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that this telegram is true, but we must remember that it
is only <i>news</i>, and not <i>history</i>, and therefore we must be quite prepared
to have it contradicted next week.</p>

<p>The blockade of Crete is now complete. No ships are allowed to enter the
ports that bring supplies to the Cretans or Greeks.</p>

<p>But the Greeks are not submitting tamely to the blockade.</p>

<p>There are two forts that guard the entrance to Canea, and both of them are
being vigorously besieged by the insurgents, with the intention of
establishing a blockade of Canea on the landward side, and so keeping the
troops of the Powers enclosed where they can do little harm.<a name="Page_636" id="Page_636"></a></p>

<p>A late despatch from Crete says that the Cretans have forced the Turks to
flee from Malaxa, and have killed the garrison.</p>

<p>During the fight over Malaxa, the Turkish warships in the Bay of Suda
opened fire on the Cretans, with the hope of dislodging them from the
heights around Malaxa. The Powers have had the grace to be very much
disturbed at this, and have sent word to the admirals in command of the
fleets at Crete, that they may use their own best judgment about ordering
the Turkish warships to leave Crete.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/12.jpg"><img src="./images/12-tb.jpg" alt="The Turkish Bastion in Canea with the flags of the six Powers flying." title="The Turkish Bastion in Canea with the flags of the six Powers flying." /></a></p>

<p>The admirals decided that the forts of Malaxa and Keratide must be kept
out of the hands of the Cretans, and so they sent word to the insurgents
that the Powers forbade them to attack either fort.</p>

<p>The Cretans did not take the slightest notice of this <a name="Page_637" id="Page_637"></a>order, but
continued the attack, and drove the Turks out. The allied warships in the
Bay of Suda at once opened fire on the Cretans, who withstood the fire
bravely.</p>

<p>The result of the whole matter has been that, though the insurgents gained
a decided victory over the Turks, the foreign Powers have stepped in
between them and their prize, and are occupying the town of Malaxa.</p>

<p>The Cretans must heartily wish that the Powers would go away and mind
their own business, and leave them to settle their own affairs.</p>

<p>If it were not so sad and so serious, it would be amusing to watch the
double game that Turkey is playing with the Powers, and how she is
laughing in her sleeve at the whole of Europe.</p>

<p>After months of conferences, and diplomatic fussing over plans of mighty
reforms which the Sultan was to make for the unfortunate Armenians, the
&quot;unspeakable Turk&quot; has not made one single effort to improve the condition
of these unhappy people. He has waited until the Powers of Europe have so
tangled themselves up over him, that he finds them befriending him, and
firing on brother Christians for his sweet sake, while he is still at
liberty to have a few more Armenians massacred without the fear of any
consequences.</p>

<p>News has just come that there has been another slaughter of Armenians,
seven hundred of these unfortunate people having fallen victims to the
Turks. If the Powers have any conscience left, this news must have made
them thoroughly ashamed of their ridiculous position.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638"></a></p>

<p>The week's news from Cuba is still of the same hopeful character for the
Cubans.</p>

<p>It is stated on the best authority that the Cubans are in absolute
possession of the eastern end of the island, the whole province of
Santiago de Cuba being in the hands of the insurgents.</p>

<div class="figleft"><a href="./images/14.jpg"><img src="./images/14-tb.jpg" alt="Gen. Maximo Gomez" title="Gen. Maximo Gomez" /></a></div>

<p>It is stated that this province is really <i>Cuba Libre</i>, or &quot;Free Cuba.&quot;
The government is being carried on there, and the peasants are able to sow
their fields and gather their crops in peace and safety.</p>

<p>The Cubans assert that if we would only recognize that they were engaged
in a real war, and give them the right to fit out a navy for themselves,
the war would be over in a very short time. They have now no fear but that
they will gain their liberty; they say, however, that with the Spanish
navy guarding the coast, and preventing the landing of help and supplies,
the war will last a good deal longer than it ought.</p>

<p>The Spaniards are very uneasy, and Havana is greatly alarmed over the last
expedition of General Weyler. The Spanish general has determined to force
<a name="Page_639" id="Page_639"></a>a battle on General Gomez, and to make one great effort to subdue him.</p>

<p>It is reported that General Gomez is in Santa Clara, and Weyler has gone
thither with all the troops he can mass together to meet him.</p>

<p>All Cuba has, however, learned by this time that the whereabouts of Gomez
and his army are never to be relied on. The Spaniards go out to fight them
in a certain place, and when they reach the spot where they expect the
enemy to be, they find that the Cubans have made a forced march and
escaped them, and are making war in quite a fresh section of the country.
The Cubans have accomplished some of the most wonderful marches in the
history of war, and have won many of their advantages by stealing past the
enemy that was advancing to fight them, and capturing towns and stores
left unprotected in the enemy's rear.</p>

<p>It is therefore not to be wondered at that there is a report in Havana
that Gomez has slipped past Weyler, and is advancing upon the city to
capture it.</p>

<p>If Gomez feels himself strong enough to fight a real <a name="Page_640" id="Page_640"></a>battle with Weyler,
it may perhaps be the decisive battle of the war.</p>

<p>All the Cuban generals have had good luck lately, but the most successful
and brilliant work has been done by General Calixto Garcia in Santiago.</p>

<p>Lest you should feel confused when hearing of so many generals, and so
many provinces, it is perhaps as well to explain something about the
formation of the island of Cuba.</p>

<p>It is a narrow, mountainous strip of land, 760 miles long and in some
parts only 28 miles wide, the very broadest part being 127 miles.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>You can readily see that no one general could control the whole of such a
country.</p>

<p>The Cuban army has been divided into three parts:</p>

<p>The Eastern Division, under General Calixto Garcia, which is fighting in
and has brought peace to Santiago de Cuba, the most eastern part of the
island.</p>

<p>The Central Division, under the leadership of General Maximo Gomez,
against which Weyler has set out, and which is supposed to be in Santa
Clara.</p>

<p>The Western division, consisting of the bands that have been raiding the
suburbs of Havana, and making so much trouble in Pinar del Rio, the most
westerly province of the island.</p>

<p>The brilliant feat that General Garcia has accomplished is that he has
made a force of nearly three thousand Spanish soldiers come out to meet
him, and after pretending to fall back before them until he had lured them
to a certain place, he has turned upon <a name="Page_641" id="Page_641"></a>them, and chased them into the
mountains, until he has finally forced them into the Algones Valley.</p>

<p>In this valley they are completely cut off from their friends, and he has
them at his mercy. News is hourly expected that the entire Spanish force
has either surrendered or been killed.</p>

<p>If this is true, it will be a very severe blow to Spain.</p>

<p>Reliable news has come that another part of Gomez's force has captured the
town of Holguin, an important town in Santiago de Cuba, and one of the few
strong-holds the Spanish still held in that province. It is said that
quantities of stores and ammunition fell into the Cubans' hands.</p>

<p>A telegram from Havana says that Fondeviella, now a lieutenant-colonel,
has been made Chief of Police in Havana. The Spaniards must certainly
approve of this horrible man's conduct, and Havana is likely to feel still
more uneasy with such a person in power. A later telegram reports the
capture of General Ruis Rivera, who was in command of the Western
Division. If this is true it will be a sad check to the Cuban successes.</p>
<div class="footnotes">FOOTNOTE:
<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a>A very good map of Cuba may be purchased on news-stands for

<p>Reports have come that the dynamite-gun, of which the Cubans were so
proud, has proved a failure.</p>

<p>The various nations, all over the world, are watching the trial of this
gun with the greatest interest. It can be so easily handled, can be
carried by ten men, and put together and made ready for firing two minutes
after it is unloaded, that other nations are anxious to see if it is
really the valuable weapon it is claimed to be.<a name="Page_642" id="Page_642"></a></p>

<p>Besides the advantages of being light and easy to handle, it can be fired
without noise or smoke, and therefore its whereabouts are not easily
discovered by an enemy; and moreover, if it has to be abandoned in a
retreat, it can be disabled with one sharp blow of a stone, so that it can
never be turned on its fleeing owners by a victorious enemy.</p>

<p>If the report about it is true, it has one fault, that is so serious that
it outweighs all the virtues. This fault is that the dynamite-gun has a
habit of going off at both ends; that is to say, it is liable to explode
both at the breech and the muzzle. It may therefore be quite as
destructive to the army firing it, as to the enemy at which it is fired.</p>

<p>Of course this will render the gun very unpopular, if it is true; but
people who understand the weapon declare that the fault lies, not in the
gun, but with the climate of the West Indies.</p>

<p>The three tubes of this gun (which we described fully in Number 6 of
<span class='smcap'>The Great Round World</span>) are fastened together at the breech with a
clasp which holds the whole mechanism of the gun in place.</p>

<p>The climate of the West Indies is so moist that metal rusts in an
amazingly short space of time, and it is difficult to keep anything bright
and polished.</p>

<p>It is supposed by those who understand the gun that, having been
constantly exposed to the moist air, it has rusted, and that the important
clasp has become so rusty that it can no longer be pushed fully home, and
so the gun is not secure.</p>

<p>In their opinion the failure of the dynamite-gun has not been proved; it
may be necessary to make some <a name="Page_643" id="Page_643"></a>alterations to fit it for service in swampy
countries, but that as a weapon it is still a success.</p>

<p>Terrible floods are reported from the Mississippi Valley. A section of the
country equal in size to the whole State of Missouri is now under water,
and steamboats are hurrying over what were once farm lands, rescuing the
unfortunate families who have been caught by the floods.</p>

<p>The Mississippi, the largest river on our continent, flows through what is
known as the Gulf Coast Plain.</p>

<p>The Gulf Coast Plain is formed by the valley lying between the great
mountain ranges which make the framework of our country.</p>

<p>The Mississippi with its tributaries drains the whole of the enormous
tract of land lying between these three main mountain ranges.</p>

<p>This great river forms the highway for the interior of our country, and
winds through the plain for about a thousand miles. Every year when the
heavy spring rains fall, and the snows melt in the north, the river
overflows its bed, and floods the lowlands around it.</p>

<p>To keep the river within its bounds, mounds of earth, called levees, have
been built for hundreds of miles along the banks. The Mississippi floods
are only dangerous when the thaws are very sudden, or the rains so heavy
that the river swells in size to such an extent that the levees are broken
down, and the water, bursting its bounds, rushes with an angry flood over
the surrounding country, destroying everything in its path.</p>

<p>As a usual thing the spring floods are beneficial to the country, for the
Mississippi is a very muddy river, <a name="Page_644" id="Page_644"></a>and when it overflows it spreads this
mud over the country, in much the same fashion that the Nile does, and
with the same result of fertilizing and enriching the soil.</p>

<p>All swift waters wash away some portion of their bed in their flow, and
carry it along with them in their journey to the sea.</p>

<p>The Mississippi in its thousand-mile course carries a vast amount of this
stolen earth, so much indeed that every year it deposits in the Gulf of
Mexico an amount of mud which would make a pile one mile square and 268
feet high.</p>

<div class="figleft"><a href="./images/20.jpg"><img src="./images/20-tb.jpg" alt="Map of North America" title="Map of North America" /></a></div>


<p>This enormous yearly deposit is literally filling up the Gulf, and in the
ages to come dry land and a new country will be found where the waters of
the Gulf now lie.</p>

<p>Every year the Mississippi brings down enough earth with it to help it
move its mouth 338 feet farther out into the sea, and every year it builds
on to its delta, which now contains thousands of square miles!</p>

<p>You can understand that the angry flood of such a powerful river as this
must be a very serious matter. For a distance of nearly twenty miles in
Arkansas, levees <a name="Page_645" id="Page_645"></a>have given way, and thousands of acres of land have been
flooded; the waters sweeping away the homes, drowning the cattle, and
compelling the people to seek the points above the angry waters, and wait
in the hope of relief-boats coming to save them.</p>

<p>In other parts of the country through which the river flows, special
trains loaded with sacks are being run to points near the river banks. The
sacks are filled with earth, and thrown upon the levees to strengthen
them. The men of that country are working night and day to shore up the
levees until the floods subside.</p>

<p>This is the worst flood that has been known for many years, and people
along the banks of the Mississippi have been ruined through the damage
done by the waters.</p>

<p>March 22d was celebrated throughout Germany as a national holiday, for it
was on this day one hundred years ago that Emperor William I. was born.</p>

<p>The old Emperor was the man who, with the help of Bismarck, united all the
various States and Principalities of Germany under one rule, and raised
Germany from the dust into which Napoleon had thrown her, to the glorious
position she holds to-day.</p>

<p>The day was celebrated in Berlin by the unveiling of a magnificent
monument to the old Emperor.</p>

<p>The statue of William I. shows him seated on horseback, with winged
figures representing Victory standing on the pedestal beneath him, and the
Goddess of Peace holding the bridle of his horse.</p>

<p><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646"></a>On the base of the pedestal is carved:</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border=".1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="William the Great, Epitaph, front">
<tr><td align='center'>WILLIAM THE GREAT,<br /><br />
German Emperor&mdash;King of Prussia,<br /><br />

<p>And on the back:</p>

<table border=".1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="William the Grea, Epitaph, back">
<tr><td align='center'>With gratitude and faithful love,<br /><br />
The German People.</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>The Emperor unveiled the monument in the presence of a great number of
German Princes and nobles, all of whom laid wreaths at the foot of the
monument.</p>

<p>In consequence of the recent troubles over his &quot;revelations,&quot; Prince
Bismarck was not invited to take part in the ceremonies. Many people
thought the young Emperor should have invited him in spite of everything;
but the people of Germany did not forget the man who had done so much for
them, and throughout the entire day telegrams and messages were showered
upon the old Iron Chancellor, by those who appreciated all he had done for
their country.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The New York Zoological Society has been presented with a tract of land
containing 261 acres, for the making of a Zoological Garden, which it is
intended shall be the finest in the world. The land presented to the
Society is in Bronx Park.</p>

<p>The Zoo is to be finished within three years, and to be free to the public
at least four days of the week, <a name="Page_647" id="Page_647"></a>including Sundays and all half holidays;
it is to be open not less than seven hours every day.</p>

<p>Work is to be begun this spring, and the Vice-President of the Society
promises to have a part of the garden ready to open to the public next
spring.</p>

<p>The Society agrees to prepare the park grounds, and erect such buildings
as are necessary to house the animals, and the City agrees to take care of
the animals and grounds after they are ready.</p>

<p>This great work is being done by some public-spirited citizens, and when
we get our Zoo we shall have to thank these good people for it.</p>

<p>The Botanical Garden, which is in course of preparation, will also be in
Bronx Park, and many of the same people who are working to get a
Zoological Garden for us have also helped to provide New York with its
Botanical Garden.</p>

<p>One lady, Mrs. Esther Hermann, gave ten thousand dollars for the Botanical
Garden&mdash;which, according to the latest report, will be opened this summer.</p>

<h2>ROUGHING IT IN A GOLD MINE.</h2>


<p><span class='smcap'>Dear Editor:</span></p>

<p>I am not a subscriber to your interesting little paper, <span class='smcap'>The Great
Round World,</span> but my teacher Miss Margaret Gannon subscribed for this
paper and she reads it to us, that is, to the class, when it comes. I was
very much interested in the letter &quot;Little Friend&quot; wrote to you. She must
be a very kind-hearted little girl. It may be interesting to some of your
readers to hear how I went to a gold mine and got out some gold. As I was
going to &quot;rough it&quot; I only took my rifle, mackintosh, and boots, and a
small valise with my other necessary articles. I got on the train, and it
took two hours for me to get to the little station at Cedar Falls, N.C.
The mine was two miles from the village. I reached there at five o'clock.
The little shanty where we lived while we were there was about twelve feet
long by eight feet wide.</p>

<p>The bunks were folded up during the day and unfolded at night.</p>

<p>After hanging up my gun and putting my valise in the corner, I went to the
shaft or hole from which the gold ore is taken. After the two men went
down the shaft, the men at the top hauled up the bucket, and they put in
the tools, which were eight sharp drills, an eight-pound sledge-hammer,
and a scraper about three feet long. I got in among the tools, and down I
went. It was warm above, but on the way down the shaft, which was thirty
feet deep, it became cooler and damper. I stood on one side with a small
pick to cut out nuggets, while the men drilled a hole <a name="Page_649" id="Page_649"></a>about two inches in
diameter and one foot deep, which they afterward filled with dynamite.
After sending the tools up, the other man and I went up, while the man we
left in the shaft lit the fuse. We all pulled at the windlass, and he was
soon at the top. After taking off the bucket we ran up the hill about a
hundred yards to watch the result.</p>

<p>With an awful explosion and a tremendous shower of rocks the dynamite blew
a big hole in the side of the shaft. After driving out the smoke by
dropping large cedar bushes in the shaft, we went down again.</p>

<p>We filled the bucket with rocks, which were drawn up. We soon emptied the
shaft in this way. Then we went to the top and assorted the ore. I filled
a large box with the richest rocks I could find, and they were shipped the
next day.</p>

<p>Besides blasting for the ore, I panned a little, that is, I had a shallow
pan with a little of the dust from the shaft and some water. I washed the
dust until I had very little dust left; then I took a quill toothpick and
picked the small nuggets from the pan and put them into a small gold vial
full of water.</p>

<p>After staying at the mine four days, I went home, having had a fine time
&quot;roughing it&quot; in a gold mine.</p>

<p>Please send me full particulars of the &quot;Who? When? What? Chart&quot; as soon as
you possibly can, and also tell me whether you will send me one of those
books which you want criticised. I am eleven years old. I like to read
very much&mdash;history, travel, and adventure being my favorites. The books I
like specially are Oliver Optic's works for travels, and G.A. Henty's
works for historical facts and thrilling adventures. I like other books
also.<a name="Page_650" id="Page_650"></a></p>

<h2>EXHIBITION OF CHILDREN'S WORK.</h2>


<p>There has been a very interesting exhibition, in New York, of sewing done
by the children in the public schools.</p>

<p>France, England, Germany, Switzerland, Russia, China, and Japan have all
sent exhibits of their work, and so it has been possible to see what kind
of sewing is being done all over the world.</p>

<p>It is very much to the credit of America that the home work far outshines
that of any of the foreign countries.</p>

<p>This exhibition was not one of fancy work or embroideries, though every
country sent some specimens of the special work for which it is
celebrated. The work shown was plain sewing, the cutting and making of new
garments, and the mending of old ones.</p>

<p>The first principles of sewing were shown on neat little squares of
cloth&mdash;running, hemming, stitching, gathering, and buttonhole-making. Then
there were garments in which all these first steps were applied.</p>

<p>While every country has sent specimens of clothing made by its children,
and each exhibits its own system of teaching sewing, none of these systems
seem so complete nor the finished garments so perfect as those of our own
country.</p>

<p>In foreign countries no particular attention seems <a name="Page_651" id="Page_651"></a>to be paid to the
cutting, shaping, and ornamenting of garments. The little underclothes
from Switzerland and Germany, especially, were made of such coarse cloth,
of such a hideous pattern, and so utterly without ornament, that it is not
pleasant to think there are really people in the world contented to wear
such unsightly clothes.</p>

<p>In the American exhibit, every garment, for rich child or poor child, had
its little frill of lace, or its row of feather-stitching, which gave it a
finish that was very pretty.</p>

<p>The daintiest set of garments came from the Industrial School for Colored
and Indian Children, in Hampton, Va.</p>

<p>The most complete exhibit, which included plain sewing, dress-making,
hat-trimming, and fancy work of all kinds, was sent by the Pratt
Institute, in Brooklyn. The useful sewing from that school was above the
standard of excellence, and the art work fully equal to that of the New
York School of Applied Design.</p>

<p>A very interesting part of the exhibit of every American school was the
darning and patching. We hear a good deal about people not learning to sew
properly nowadays, since the sewing-machine has come into such common use,
but the patches and darns shown by the twelve-year-old pupils of our
public schools would put the far-famed patching of our grandmothers to
shame.</p>

<p>There were square patches, with the patterns matched so exquisitely that
you had to feel the edge before you could realize that the patch was
there; three-cornered &quot;jags&quot; darned so perfectly with their <a name="Page_652" id="Page_652"></a>own threads
that they were invisible, and every kind of rent and tear and hole was
treated in its own particular way.</p>

<p>The Japanese sent a number of beautiful designs for embroidery, and a case
full of queer little Japanese garments, but unfortunately they, too, were
made of coarse materials, and looked ugly and uninteresting.</p>

<p>Russia sent Russian lace, and a number of photographs of school children
learning to sew. They also sent some lovely Russian embroidery, but no
plain sewing.</p>

<p>Mexico had a case full of wonderful drawn work; France some wonderful
designs for dresses, and some beautifully finished dress-waists, but the
little under-garments were as coarse as those of Switzerland. This was a
disappointment, because we always suppose that France sets the fashion for
daintiness.</p>

<p>Two very interesting pieces of work had been loaned for the occasion: one,
a sofa cushion worked by Martha Washington; and the other a map of England
and Wales, done in Berlin wools by George Washington's aunt.</p>

<p>The map was beautifully worked, and was a marvel of neatness, with the
counties all outlined in different colors, and their names worked in with
very fine stitches.</p>

<p>Of Martha Washington's handiwork it is hard to speak. It was the ugliest
sofa cushion you can imagine, worked in browns so that it should not show
the dirt, and with such irregular stitches that either Madam Washington
must have been losing her sight when she worked it, or else she was a very
poor needle-woman.<a name="Page_653" id="Page_653"></a></p>

<p>The American exhibit had one wonderful case of work done by the blind. It
consisted of patches with specimens of sewing and running on them, a great
many very fairly done buttonholes, and several little dolls' aprons very
neatly hemmed, and gathered with fine, even gathers.</p>

<p>It seemed impossible to believe that the hands that did this work had no
eyes to guide them. The buttonholes were so well made that they looked
like the work of some careful, clever young children.</p>

<p>What a wonderful age we live in! Fancy bringing the art of teaching to
such perfection that the blind can be taught to sew! Our young folks ought
to be very thankful that they are growing up at a time when teachers
endeavor to make learning a pleasure as well as a profit. G.H.R.</p>

<h2>BOOK REVIEWS.</h2>


<p>We publish the following letter about the &quot;Carved Cartoon&quot;:</p>

<p>This book deserves every word of praise given to it by our correspondent.
It is one of the most delightful stories written. It treats of the
adventures of Grinling Gibson, the famous carver in wood, who carved
flowers so delicately that they could absolutely move on their stems.

<div class="blockquot"><i>To the Editor:</i>

<p>    <span class='smcap'>Dear Sir</span>.&mdash;Every year the cry for books increases.
    &quot;Tell us what to read,&quot; is the constantly repeated demand, and
    parents, teachers, and publishers are often at a loss to keep
    the active brains of our young people <a name="Page_654" id="Page_654"></a>supplied with sound,
    wholesome, and interesting literature.</p>

<p>    Science, art, history, and zoology are presented to the little
    ones in varied and attractive forms, and now <span class='smcap'>The Great Round
    World</span> has come forward to fill a long-felt want by giving
    the boys and girls clean, healthy, and concise accounts of what
    is taking place in their own and other countries.</p>

<p>    It has always seemed strange to me that so few parents place in
    their children's hands that beautiful story entitled the &quot;Carved
    Cartoon.&quot; It is a book of breathless interest, containing the
    adventures of a young artist and a boy musician during the great
    London plague and fire.</p>

<p>    The story is founded on fact, and the author's pen holds the
    reader entranced as it vividly pictures the stirring scenes of
    those thrilling years.</p>

<p>    The noble character and brilliant talents of the young hero
    shine star-like through the surrounding darkness of greed,
    avarice, and poverty.</p>

<p>    Trusting that no boy or girl will let an opportunity to read
    this fascinating book slip by, I am very cordially your
    interested reader,</p></div>

long. We do not think that this country will help Cuba. It hardly seems
necessary now that we should help; the Spaniards are losing ground every
day, and it will probably be best for the United States to wait until the
brave little island has fought her last battle, and then let Uncle Sam
come forward and help Cuba to re-establish her commerce.</p>

<p>    I enjoy <span class='smcap'>The Great Round World</span> very much indeed, and
    wish the dreadful war with Cuba would stop; but I do not want
    the Cubans to give up; it is just like the Revolutionary War
    with us; we did not give up, and I hope Cuba won't.</p>

<p>    I have a little black and tan dog, and call him Jack. He is very
    cunning indeed, he has a hard rubber ball he plays with. There
    also is another black and tan dog in the house whose name is
    Gipsy; she, also, is very cunning.</p></div>

freedom.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
